//To count the number of consonants in a string using C++ STL, you can use the std::count_if() algorithm with a lambda function that tests whether each character is a consonant. Here's an example:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::string s = "Hello World!";
    int consonant_count = std::count_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](char c) {
        return std::isalpha(c) && std::string("AEIOUaeiou").find(c) == std::string::npos;
    });
    std::cout << "The number of consonants in \"" << s << "\" is: " << consonant_count << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
/*In this example, a std::string is created and initialized with the value "Hello World!". The std::count_if() function is then called on the range of characters in the string, with a lambda function provided as the third argument. This lambda function takes a character c and returns a boolean value indicating whether c is a consonant (std::isalpha(c) && std::string("AEIOUaeiou").find(c) == std::string::npos). The std::count_if() function counts the number of elements for which this function returns true. The std::isalpha() function is used to exclude non-alphabetic characters from the count. Finally, the resulting count is printed to the console.

The output of this code will be "The number of consonants in "Hello World!" is: 7", which represents the number of consonants in the original string.

Note that std::count_if() can be used to count any subset of elements from a container, based on a specified condition. The std::string::find() function is used in the lambda function to search for the current character within a string of vowels (AEIOUaeiou).
