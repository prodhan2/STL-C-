The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides a wide range of functions for various purposes. Here's a list of some of the commonly used functions in the STL:

std::sort(): Sorts a range of elements in a container using a comparison function or operator.

std::find(): Searches a range of elements in a container for a specific value and returns an iterator to the first occurrence of that value.

std::copy(): Copies a range of elements from one container to another.

std::transform(): Applies a function to a range of elements in a container and stores the results in another container.

std::accumulate(): Computes the sum or product of a range of elements in a container.

std::unique(): Removes consecutive duplicates from a range of elements in a container.

std::reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in a range of elements in a container.

std::rotate(): Rotates a range of elements in a container by a specified number of positions.

std::fill(): Assigns a value to a range of elements in a container.

std::max_element() and std::min_element(): Returns an iterator to the maximum or minimum element in a range of elements in a container.

std::count(): Counts the number of occurrences of a specific value in a range of elements in a container.

std::string::find(): Searches a string for a specific substring and returns the index of the first occurrence.

std::string::substr(): Returns a substring of a string starting at a specified index and with a specified length.

std::vector::push_back(): Adds an element to the end of a vector.

std::map::insert(): Inserts a key-value pair into a map.

These are just a few examples of the many functions provided by the STL. Each container in the STL also has a variety of member functions that provide additional functionality.
