//The isalpha() function is a C standard library function that checks whether a character is an alphabetic character (either uppercase or lowercase). In C++, you can use the std::isalpha() function from the <cctype> header to achieve the same result.

//Here's an example that uses std::isalpha() to check whether each character in a string is an alphabetic character:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>

int main() {
    std::string s = "Hello, world!";
    for (char c : s) {
        if (std::isalpha(c)) {
            std::cout << c << " is an alphabetic character." << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << c << " is not an alphabetic character." << std::endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
/*In this example, a std::string is created and initialized with the value "Hello, world!". The string is then iterated over using a range-based for loop, and each character is checked using the std::isalpha() function. If the character is an alphabetic character, a message indicating so is printed to the console. Otherwise, a message indicating that the character is not an alphabetic character is printed.

The output of this code will be:

csharp
Copy code
H is an alphabetic character.
e is an alphabetic character.
l is an alphabetic character.
l is an alphabetic character.
o is an alphabetic character.
, is not an alphabetic character.
  is not an alphabetic character.
w is an alphabetic character.
o is an alphabetic character.
r is an alphabetic character.
l is an alphabetic character.
d is an alphabetic character.
! is not an alphabetic character.
Note that std::isalpha() can be used to check whether any character is an alphabetic character, regardless of whether it is uppercase or lowercase.
